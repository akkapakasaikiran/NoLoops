# NoLoops

A pure C++ implementation of the Spanning Tree Protocol which builds a loop-free logical topology of bridges and LANs. The functioning of learning bridges on a sequence of data transfers is also simulated using callacks which print to stdout. This was done as a course assignment for CS252 (Computer Networks Lab) in my second year at IITB. Object Orinted Programming was used heavily in this project.

Description of the code will probably be updated in a while.
